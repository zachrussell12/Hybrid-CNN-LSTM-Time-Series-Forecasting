# Outline of Files

## Paper File: CAP5610_FINALPAPER_RUSSELL.pdf

This file contains my final research paper on my model. It outlines my approach to the problem, how I created my model, the metrics I used to measure compare it to other similar models, my results, and any challenges or improvements I think could be iterated on. The following abstract summarizes the paper and its results: _Time series forecasting of grocery sales is an important aspect of ensuring brick-and-mortar grocery stores avoid unwanted food waste, poor profit margins, and wasted chances to capitalize on promotional opportunities. Time series forecasting has been used for other applications like financial, weather, stock price, and energy forecasting. This paper proposes utilizing a hybrid CNN-LSTM to conduct sales time series forecasting on data provided from a Kaggle competition. With an optimized architecture and hyperparameters, the model was able to produce great results, scoring a mean absolute error of 58.26 and a root mean squared error of 257.26. This model outperformed other types of long short-term memory models and gated recurrent units. The use of convolution layers in conjunction with a long short-term memory layer has shown that it does improve the ability to perform time series forecasting of sales values._

## Zip File: Data&Model.zip

This file contains all of the data used to train my model that was provided by Kaggle for the competition. It also contains a saved version of my model, so if you wanted to test it you would not need to re-train the model. 

## Model Source Code File: CAP5610_TermProject_MODEL_SOURCE_CODE_Russell-FINAL.ipynb

This file contains the source code of my model. That includes all of the pre-processing of the data, construction and training of the model, and post-processing of the results. This can be downloaded along with the data and ran locally or it can be accessed via this Google Colab [link.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lweUgn43S2vwi-zJjcB2SVOvAoWWQwwU?usp=sharing) Be sure to add all of the data and saved model file into the Google Colab instance before attempting to run the model.

## Model Comparison Source Code File: CAP5610_ModelComparison_TermProject_Russell.ipynb

This file contains all the source code used to gather data on how other similar models performed on the same set of data. This allowed me to compare my model's efficiency to other's like it to prove its improvment over them. This can be downloaded along with the data and ran locally or it can be accessed via this Google Colab [link.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nNjmnJPGbgiJo4eQ6vEJq9BmpkrGYA59?usp=sharing) Be sure to add all of the data and saved model file into the Google Colab instance before attempting to run the model.
