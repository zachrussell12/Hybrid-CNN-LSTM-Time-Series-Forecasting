I just wanted to outline what is in this Google Drive Folder so you know what to do with each file.

PAPER FILE:

CAP5610_FINALPAPER_RUSSELL.pdf	- contains final research paper



PRESENTATION:

CAP5610-FULLPRESENTATION-RUSSELL.mp4	- contains final presentation for paper



ZIP FILE:

Data&Model.zip	- contains all the data and the final model needed to test source code



MODEL SOURCE CODE FILES:

CAP5610_TermProject_MODEL_SOURCE_CODE_Russell-FINAL.ipynb    - THIS is the file containing the source code of my model

CAP5610_ModelComparison_TermProject_Russell.ipynb    - this is a file of source code used to evaluate other models against mine.

IF YOU WANT TO VIEW EACH SOURCE CODE WITHOUT HAVING TO DOWNLOAD THE FILE YOU CAN USE THE LINKS BELOW:

MODEL SOURCE CODE LINK:

MODEL COMPARISON LINK:

If you want to run the model's code you need to download the Data&Model.zip and upload it to the Google Colab instance.
